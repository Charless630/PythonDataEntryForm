# Data Entry Form
This project contains a Python script that uses the tkinter library to create a simple data entry form. The form includes fields for the user's name, title, age, nationality, and a selection for their registration status.

The user's inputs are saved in the program and can be accessed and displayed by running the program. If the user has not entered their name or has not accepted the Terms & Conditions, the program will display a warning message.

### Usage
Download the Python script data_entry_form.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python data_entry_form.py
A new window will appear displaying the data entry form.
Enter your information and select the appropriate options.
Click the "Submit" button to save your inputs and display the saved data.
